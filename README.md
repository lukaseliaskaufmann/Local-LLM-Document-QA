## ðŸ§  Why I Built This

As a technician working with Daikin systems, I constantly found myself digging through bulky PDF manuals to find error codes, wiring diagrams, or part numbersâ€”especially in the field, where internet access isnâ€™t always reliable.

I built this tool to **save time**, **reduce friction**, and **bring AI assistance offline**, directly into the hands of technicians and engineersâ€”no cloud, no internet, just answers.
